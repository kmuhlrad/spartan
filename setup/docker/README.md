# Spartan inside Docker

## Quickstart

The following is all of the steps to build spartan with docker from a fresh Ubuntu installation:

1) Install [Docker for Ubuntu](https://docs.docker.com/engine/installation/linux/docker-ce/ubuntu/)
  - Make sure to `sudo usermod -aG docker your-user` and then not run below docker scripts as `sudo`
2) Install [`nvidia-docker`](https://github.com/NVIDIA/nvidia-docker). Make sure to use `nvidia-docker1` not `nvidia-docker2` as it has a known issue with OpenGL. See [this](https://github.com/RobotLocomotion/spartan/issues/201) issue. Follow the instructions on their webpage but replace
```
sudo apt-get install -y nvidia-docker2
```
with
```
sudo apt-get install -y nvidia-docker
```
You can test that your nvidia-docker installation is working by running
```
nvidia-docker run --rm nvidia/cuda nvidia-smi
```
If you get errors about nvidia-modprobe not being installed, install it by running
```
sudo apt-get install nvidia-modprobe
```
and then restart your machine.

3) Clone, setup, and build Spartan:
```
git clone git@github.com:RobotLocomotion/spartan.git
cd spartan
git submodule init
git submodule update
./setup/docker/docker_build.py
./setup/docker/docker_run.py
mkdir build && cd build && use_ros && cmake .. && use_spartan && make -j8
```
Below is explained additional options and details of the above.

## Building Docker Image
After cloning spartan and setting up submodules, from the spartan root directory run

```./setup/docker/docker_build.py```

to build a docker image. The default image name is `<username>-spartan` where `<username>` is your username on the host machine. Optionally you can pass the option `-i <image_name>` to specify the name of the image. Use `-h` to see a full list of command line options. Note you can also rename the image after building (see Docker Cheatsheet below).

This is a basic 16.04 environment with the necessary dependencies for `spartan` installed.

## Running a Docker Container
To create container derived from the image that was just build run (from the `spartan` root directory)

```
./setup/docker/docker_run.py
```

By default this will create a container named `<username>-spartan` derived from an image named `<username>-spartan`. It also creates a user named `<username>` inside the docker container. By default this username will match the current username on the host machine. This is important for SSH keys used in cloning private github repos to work properly. The default password for your user inside the docker container is `password`. User the `-p` flag to set a different password.

This container mounts your current
spartan directory at `/home/<username>/spartan`. You can use the optional command line arguments `-i <image_name>` to derive a container from a specific image, and `-c <container_name>` to name the container. Use `-h` to see a full list of command line arguments. By default the container will be deleted upon exiting the container (due to the `--rm` flag), but both the source code and the compiled binaries live outside the container.

See [here](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/start/) for more documentation on the `docker run` command.

## Building Spartan inside the Docker container
```
cd /root/spartan
mkdir build && cd build
use_ros
cmake ..
use_spartan
make -j
```

## Docker Cheatsheet

Handling images
- `docker images` - lists all docker images on machine, including REPOSITORY, TAG, IMAGE_ID, when created, size
- `docker tag IMAGE_ID NEW_NAME` - creates a new REPOSITORY:TAG for an IMAGE_ID
- `docker rmi REPOSITORY:TAG` - removes this tag for an image
- `docker tag IMAGE_ID my-spartan && docker rmi spartan` -- example to combine above two commands to rename an image ID

Handling containers
- `docker ps -a` - lists all containers on machine
- `docker rm CONTAINER_ID` - removes container id
